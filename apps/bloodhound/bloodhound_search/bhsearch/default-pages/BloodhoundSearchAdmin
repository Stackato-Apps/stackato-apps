= Bloodhound Search Admin=

== Admin Command ==
Bloodhound search module provides two admin commands:

'''bhsearch rebuild''' rebuilds the search index.[[BR]]
'''bhsearch optimize''' optimizes the search index by merging different index files.

== Options ==
The behaviour of Bloodhound search can be controlled by setting different options in trac.ini file.

=== Trac Integration ===
Bloodhound search can integrate with Trac on different levels, depending on the values of the following options:

'''is_default''' (default=false) - bhsearch will be used when user types a query in quick search box.[[BR]]
'''enable_redirect''' (default=false) - requests to /search url will be redirected to bhsearch.

=== Multiproduct support ===
When bhsearch is used in installations with multiple products, quick search box can be used in two different ways; it can either return results from all products (default), or only the results from the product the search is initiated in.

'''global_quicksearch''' (default=true) - do not add product filter to search queries initiated in product scope.
