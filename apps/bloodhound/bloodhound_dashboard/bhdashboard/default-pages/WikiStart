= Welcome to Apache Bloodhound =

Apache Bloodhound is a tool created for issue tracking and managing of software projects.

At the heart of this are [wiki:TracTickets Tickets]. They provide the means to record information about a task, bug or feature request.

Get started by [/newticket creating tickets] and categorise them using [/admin/ticket/products Products], [/admin/ticket/components Components], [/admin/ticket/versions Versions] or [/admin/ticket/milestones Milestones] (admin permissions required).

You can also [/wiki/TracWiki?action=edit&edit_page_button= edit this page] and create new pages, just like in any other [wiki:TracWiki Wiki].

Any questions you have should be answered in the [wiki:TracGuide extensive documentation] provided.
