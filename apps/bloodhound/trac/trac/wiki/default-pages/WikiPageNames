[[TracGuideToc]]

Wiki page names commonly use the CamelCase convention. Within wiki text, any word in CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that name.

CamelCase page names must follow these rules:

 1. The name must consist of '''alphabetic characters only'''. No digits, spaces, punctuation, or underscores are allowed.
 2. A name must have at least two capital letters.
 3. The first character must be capitalized.
 4. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
 5. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted in page names (possibly representing a hierarchy).

If you want to create a wiki page that doesn't follow CamelCase rules you can use the following syntax:
{{{
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],
   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"]
   and with a label: [wiki:"Space Matters" all about white space]
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s
 * even better, the new [[WikiCreole link style]]
   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]
}}}

This will be rendered as:
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],
   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"] ''(that page name embeds space characters)''
   and with a label: [wiki:"Space Matters" all about white space]
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s ''(old !MoinMoin's internal free links style)''
 * even better, the new [[WikiCreole link style]]
   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]
   ''(since 0.12, also now adopted by !MoinMoin)''


Starting with Trac 0.11, it's also possible to link to a specific ''version'' of a Wiki page, as you would do for a specific version of a file, for example: WikiStart@1.

You can also prevent a CamelCase name to be interpreted as a TracLinks, by quoting it. See TracLinks#EscapingLinks.

As visible in the example above, one can also append an anchor to a Wiki page name, in order to link to a specific section within that page. The anchor can easily be seen by hovering the mouse over a section heading, then clicking on the [[html(&para;)]] sign that appears at its end. The anchor is usually generated automatically, but it's also possible to specify it explicitly: see WikiFormatting#using-explicit-id-in-heading.
