= The Trac Timeline =
[[TracGuideToc]]

The timeline provides a historic view of the project in a single report.

It lists all Trac events that have occurred in chronological order, a
brief description of each event and if applicable, the person responsible for
the change.

The timeline lists these kinds of events:
 * '''Wiki page events''' — Creation and changes
 * '''Ticket events''' — Creation and resolution/closing (and optionally other changes)
 * '''Source code changes ''' — Repository check-ins
 * '''Milestone ''' — Milestone completed

Each event entry provides a hyperlink to the specific event in question, who authored the change as well as
a brief excerpt of the actual comment or text, if available.

It is possible to filter the displayed events with the various filters in the option panel:
 * ''View changes from'' — the date from which to start displaying events (current date if empty). Events that occurred after this date will not be shown, only those that occurred before that date.
 * ''and X days back'' — how many days backwards in time to get events.
 * ''done by'' — the author of an event. It accepts a space-separated list of authors for which events should be included. Alternatively, if the author names are prefixed by a "-" character, then the events having those authors will be excluded, and all the others included. Single or double quotes can be used for specifying author names containing space characters. ''(since 0.12)''
 * ''Changesets in all repositories'' — if you have more than one repository connected to your Trac project, then you can filter the output so events from specific repositories are not shown. ''(since 0.12)''
 * ''Milestones reached'' — display or hide milestones reached.
 * ''Opened and closed tickets'' — display or hide ticket open or close events.
 * ''Wiki changes'' — display or hide Wiki change events.
