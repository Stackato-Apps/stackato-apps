= Installing Trac as CGI =

CGI script is the entrypoint that web-server calls when a web-request to an application is made. To generate the `trac.cgi` script run:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/env deploy /path/to/www/trac
}}}
`trac.cgi` will be in the `cgi-bin` folder inside the given path. ''Make sure it is executable by your web server''. This command also copies `static resource` files to a `htdocs` directory of a given destination.

== Apache web-server configuration ==

In [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] there are two ways to run Trac as CGI:

 1. Use a `ScriptAlias` directive that maps an URL to the `trac.cgi` script (recommended)
 2. Copy the `trac.cgi` file into the directory for CGI executables used by your web server (commonly named `cgi-bin`). You can also create a symbolic link, but in that case make sure that the `FollowSymLinks` option is enabled for the `cgi-bin` directory.

To make Trac available at `http://yourhost.example.org/trac` add `ScriptAlias` directive to Apache configuration file, changing `trac.cgi` path to match your installation:
{{{
ScriptAlias /trac /path/to/www/trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi
}}}

 ''Note that this directive requires enabled `mod_alias` module.''

If you're using Trac with a single project you need to set its location using the `TRAC_ENV` environment variable:
{{{
<Location "/trac">
  SetEnv TRAC_ENV "/path/to/projectenv"
</Location>
}}}

Or to use multiple projects you can specify their common parent directory using the `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` variable:
{{{
<Location "/trac">
  SetEnv TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR "/path/to/project/parent/dir"
</Location>
}}}

 ''Note that the `SetEnv` directive requires enabled `mod_env` module. It is also possible to set TRAC_ENV in trac.cgi. Just add the following code between "try:" and "from trac.web ...":''

{{{
    import os
    os.environ['TRAC_ENV'] = "/path/to/projectenv"
}}}

 '' Or for TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR: ''

{{{
    import os
    os.environ['TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR'] = "/path/to/project/parent/dir"
}}}

If you are using the [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html Apache suEXEC] feature please see [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/ApacheSuexec].

On some systems, you ''may'' need to edit the shebang line in the `trac.cgi` file to point to your real Python installation path. On a Windows system you may need to configure Windows to know how to execute a .cgi file (Explorer -> Tools -> Folder Options -> File Types -> CGI).

=== Using WSGI ===

You can run a [http://henry.precheur.org/python/how_to_serve_cgi WSGI handler] [http://pythonweb.org/projects/webmodules/doc/0.5.3/html_multipage/lib/example-webserver-web-wsgi-simple-cgi.html under CGI].  You can [wiki:TracModWSGI#Thetrac.wsgiscript write your own application function], or use the deployed trac.wsgi's application.
